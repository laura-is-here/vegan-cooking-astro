## Ingredients

- 1 x 454g pkg Brown Rice Spirals (or about 5 cups of noodles of your choice)
- 1/4 tsp sea salt
- 1 C frozen peas
- 2 tbsp tahini
- 2 tbsp nutritional yeast
- 1 tbsp lemon juice
- 1 tbsp olive oil
- 1 tbsp mellow white miso
- 1 tbsp soy sauce
- 1 garlic clove, minced
- 1 C pasta water (reserved from boiling pasta)

## Instructions

1. Bring a large pot of water to a boil with sea salt.
2. In a dish mix together tahini, lemon juice, olive oil, white miso, nutritional yeast, tamari, and garlic. Set aside.
3. Once the water is at a rolling boil, add in brown rice pasta and cook for approximately 10 minutes or until al dente. Add frozen peas to the boiling water during the last minute of cooking.
4. Reserve 1 cup of pasta water right before draining. Then drain the pasta and peas. Do not rinse, and put the noodles back in the large pot.
5. Add the sauce and a 1/2 cup of pasta water to start and stir to combine with the noodles and peas over low heat on the stovetop. Stir constantly to allow the noodles to get coated, adding more pasta water as necessary to create a creamy consistency. Don't heat for longer than 2 to 3 minutes.
6. Top with fresh cracked black pepper and serve immediately.
