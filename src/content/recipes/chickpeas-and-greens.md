## Ingredients

- 2 Tbsp olive oil
- 1 rosemary sprig
- 4 to 5 cloves garlic
- 1/4 tsp freshly ground black pepper
- 1/4 tsp red pepper flakes
- 12 oz fresh greens (chard & kale work great)
- 1 1/2 cups chickpeas, drained & rinsed if from can
- 3 cups water or broth
- 2 tsp salt
- Splash of white wine vinegar
- Parmesan

## Process

### Prep

Remove the leaves from the sprig of rosemary. Crush and mince the garlic, and chop the greens into small to medium sized strips or chunks, depending on your preference, discarding any large sections of stem.

### Saute

Add the olive oil, garlic, and rosemary leaves to a medium pan and place over medium heat. Once the oil is heated, add in black pepper and red pepper flakes and saute everything over medium heat for another minute, making sure the garlic and spices don't burn.

Add in a handful of greens, just enough to cover the bottom of your pan, and stir to coat evenly with the garlic and oil. Once the first handful of greens are wilted, about 1 to 2 minutes, depending on size, add in another handful, repeating until all of your greens are cooked.

### Simmer
