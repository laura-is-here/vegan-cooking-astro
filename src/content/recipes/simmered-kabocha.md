## Ingredients

- 1 pound kabocha squash, cut into 2 inch pieces (probably 1/2 of a kabocha)
- 1 3/4 cups dashi
- 1 Tbsp sugar
- 2 Tbsp sake (sub Shaoxing wine)
- 2 tsp soy sauce
- 1/4 tsp salt

## Process

1. Microwave the kabocha for 2 minutes to soften the outer skin before cutting into two each pieces.
2. Combine dashi, sugar, sake, soy sauce, and salt.
3. Arrange kabocha skin side down in a single layer in a heavy-bottomed pan.
4. Pour in the dashi mixture and bring to a simmer.
5. Cover with a [drop-lid (otoshibuta)](https://www.justonecookbook.com/how-to-make-otoshi-buta/), reduce heat to low to bring to a low simmer, and let cook for 30 minutes until kabocha is tender and beginning to separate at the bottom from the skin.
6. Cover the pan with a lid and let sit for 5 - 10 minutes or longer to allow kabocha to absorb the rest of the liquid.
