## Ingredients

- 1 pound your favorite small pasta shape
- 1 Cup raw, unsalted cashews, soaked
- 3/4 Cup water
- 2 Tbsp lemon juice
- 1 Tbsp miso
- 2 Tbsp nutritional yeast
- 1/2 tsp salt
- 1/4 Cup Vegan Butter
- 1/4 Cup Flour
- 1 1/2 Cups Unsweetened Soy Milk
- 1 Tbsp Dijon Mustard
- 1/2 tsp Cayenne Pepper
- 1/2 Cup Vegan Cheddar Shreds
- Salt and Pepper to taste

## Process

### Make the Cashew Cheese

Blend cashews, water, lemon juice, miso, nutritional yeast, and salt in a high-speed blender until smooth. Set aside.

### Make the Bechamel

Melt butter over medium heat in a medium-sized pot. Add flour and cook for one to two minutes, stirring constantly. Slowly stream in the soy milk, whisking constantly to incorporate. Season with mustard, cayenne pepper, and salt to taste, and let simmer until thickened, stirring regularly.

### Assemble

Mix vegan cheddar shreds and half of the cashew cheese into the bechamel, heating until shreds are melted and well incorporated. In a large pot, mix together the cheese sauce with your cooked pasta.

### Baking (optional)

If you'd like a baked mac and cheese, spray a large baking dish with spray oil and add your mixed mac and cheese. Bake at 400 degrees Fahrenheit for 10 - 15 minutes. _Note: if you plan to bake this mac and cheese, we recommend straining your pasta **before** it's done so that it may finish cooking in the cheese sauce while baking._
