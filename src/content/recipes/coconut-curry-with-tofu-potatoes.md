## Ingredients

- 3 cups (approx.) The Little Potato Company's Little Reds
- 1 tbsp + ½ tbsp coconut oil
- 1 block extra-firm tofu, cut into ¾" cubes
- 1/4 cup rice flour
- ½ onion, finely diced
- 1 rib celery, finely diced
- 2 carrots, peeled and sliced into thin rounds
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- 3 tbsp mild yellow curry powder
- 1/2 tsp turmeric
- 1/2 tsp cumin
- 1/4 tsp cayenne pepper
- 1 Tbsp sugar
- 2 tbsp chili garlic sauce
- 2-4 cups vegetable stock
- 2 cups baby kale
- 1 can coconut milk

## Directions

### Prepare the potatoes

Pierce the skin of each potato 2-3 times before microwaving on high for 4-6 minutes or until tender. Leave to cool before cutting each potato into quarters.

### Pan fry the tofu

Mix together rice flour and approximately 1 - 2 Tbsp of the spice mix in a shallow dish or gallon zip lock bag. Toss the cubes tofu in the rice flour mixture until lightly coated.

In a large non-stick skillet, heat 1 tbsp coconut oil over medium high heat. Add the cubed tofu and cook until golden-brown and crisp on at least 3-4 sides. Set aside.

### Cook the base of the curry

In the same skillet, heat the remaining ½ tbsp of coconut oil. Add the onion, celery, carrots, and garlic. Cook for 2-3 minutes, stirring often, until the onion starts to become transparent.

Add the curry powder, turmeric, cumin, cayenne, and chili garlic sauce. Cook for another 2-3 minutes, stirring often.

### Simmer

Add vegetable stock and baby kale. Simmer for 5 minutes.

Add coconut milk, sugar, pan-fried tofu, and quartered potatoes. Simmer for another 10 minutes.

### Finish and serve

Taste, thin with vegetable stock if needed, and adjust seasoning.
