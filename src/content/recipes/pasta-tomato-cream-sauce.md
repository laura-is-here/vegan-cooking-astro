## Ingredients

-3/4 cup raw unsalted cashews
-1 yellow onion, minced/chopped fine
-3-4 cloves of garlic, minced
-2 Tbsp olive oil
-Pinch of red pepper flakes 
-1/2 tsp Italian seasoning
-1 Tbsp tomato paste
-1 28oz can whole San Marzano tomatoes, blended or crushed
-Salt + pepper to taste
-1lb pasta, cooked according to package direction

## Directions

**Cashew cream:**

Soak the cashews in boiling water for at least 30 minutes. Drain and add to a blender with 3/4 cup water and a pinch of salt. Blend until very smooth. 

**Sauce:**

Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the onion and a pinch of salt and saute until translucent and soft, 5 - 7 minutes. Add the garlic and continue cooking for another minute. 

Add the red pepper flakes and Italian seasoning, stir, then add the tomato paste. Cook the tomato paste for 1 - 2 minutes, stirring frequently to prevent burning, then add the crushed/blended tomatoes. 

Simmer for 10 - 15 minutes and season to taste with salt and pepper. When done, turn off the heat and stir in half of the blended cashew cream. Continue adding the cashew cream until the sauce is at your desired level of creaminess, then heat on medium-low heat until warmed through.

Add pasta and stir to coat.

## Tips

If you don't feel like mincing the onion, you can leave it in a bigger dice and then blend the sauce after it's cooked (before or after adding the cashew cream).
