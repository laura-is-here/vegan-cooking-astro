Adjust this lentil soup recipe as you'd like for an easy weeknight meal that will feed plenty or leave you with plenty of leftovers.

I like to use whole coriander and cumin seeds and grind them up, but pre-ground will always do in a pinch.

[Mushroom broth powder](https://www.amazon.com/Totole-Granulated-Mushroom-Bouillon-Pack/dp/B007IA2D78), nutritional yeast, and MSG are optional but recommended for added depth of flavor.

## Ingredients

- 1 medium yellow onion, diced
- 4 ribs celery, chopped
- 4 carrots, chopped
- 2 teaspoons and a pinch of salt, divided
- 1 teaspoon black pepper
- 1 teaspoon cayenne
- 2 teaspoons coriander
- 2 teaspoons cumin
- 2 teaspoons curry powder
- 2 bay leaves
- 1 teaspoon garlic powder
- 2 tablespoons nutritional yeast (optional)
- 1 teaspoon mushroom broth powder (optional)
- 1/2 teaspoon MSG (optional)
- 1 pound green or brown lentils, rinsed and picked through
- 8 - 10 cups vegetable broth
- 2 medium gold potatoes, diced
- 10 ounces spinach, chopped

## Process

Heat oil in a pot over medium heat. Add onions and pinch of salt.

Saute for 4-5 minutes until translucent.

Add carrots and celery, continue to saute for 4 minutes.

Add coriander, cumin, cayenne, black pepper, garlic powder, curry powder and bay leaves. Cook for 30 second - 1 minute until fragrant.

Add broth, lentils, mushroom broth powder, nutritional yeast, MSG and remaining two teaspoons of salt.

Bring to a boil over high heat, then cover partially and reduce to a simmer. Simmer for 30 minutes, adding more water or broth as needed to cover the lentils.

Once the lentils are tender, add the potatoes and more water or broth as needed. Cook until potatoes are fork tender.

Taste for seasoning, adding more salt or black pepper as desired.

Stir in spinach, cook for 1 - 3 minutes to desired doneness.

Serve with bread, hot sauce, and/or yogurt.
