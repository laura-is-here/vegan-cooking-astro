## Ingredients

- 1 Cup Potatoes, peeled and cubed
- 1 C white potatoes, peeled and cubed
- 1/2 C carrots, peeled and cubed
- 1/4 C vegetable oil
- 1/4 C non-dairy milk
- 2 tsp lemon juice
- 6 pickled jalapeño slices
- 3 tbsp jalapeño pickle brine
- 1 tbsp tomato paste
- 1 1/2 tsp corn starch
- 1 tsp garlic powder
- 1 tsp onion powder
- 1 tbsp nutritional yeast
- 1/2 tsp sea salt

## Process

1. Boil the potatoes and carrots in pot of water for approximately 10 minutes. Drain them from the boiling water and add to a high-powered blender immediately.
   - _Note: If you cook the potatoes for too long, they will become starchy and your sauce will not be smooth._
2. Add the remaining ingredients to the blender and combine until smooth.
3. Optionally, heat queso in a small pot to thicken it slightly before serving.
