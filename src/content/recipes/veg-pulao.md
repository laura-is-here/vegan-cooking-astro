## Ingredients

- 1 cup long grain rice
- 1 green chili, slit
- 2 Tbsp butter
- 4 cloves
- 1 star anise
- 1 inch cinnamon stick
- 1 bay leaf
- 1/2 tsp cumin seeds
- 1/2 tsp fennel seeds
- 2 green cardamom pods
- 1/2 of a medium onion, diced small
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 cup petite frozen veggies
- 1 1/2 tsp salt
- 1 3/4 cups water (2 cups was too much, rice was overcooked)

## Process

Rinse the rice until water runs clear. Cover with warm water and let soak for 10 minutes.

In a heavy bottom pan, heat 2 Tbsp butter over medium heat until melted. Add all whole spices and slit green chili. Cook for 30 seconds to 1 minute until fragrant.

Add onion and cook for 3 - 4 minutes until translucent. Add garlic, cooking for 30 seconds, then add frozen veggies. Mix, and let cook for 2 minutes.

Drain the rice well, then add to the pot along with salt. Mix, then add water. Bring to a boil over high heat, then cover with a tight-fitting lid and reduce heat to low.

Cook for 15 minutes, covered, then turn the heat off and allow to rest for 10 minutes, leaving the pot covered.
