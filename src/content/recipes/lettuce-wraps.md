## Ingredients

- 1 1/2 cup TVP
- 2 tsp boullion
- 1 tsp mushroom broth powder
- 1/2 cup hot water
- Black pepper, generously
- Vegetable oil
- 3 cloves garlic
- 1 tsp sesame oil
- 1 tsp Chinese black vinegar
- 1 Tbsp dark soy sauce
- 1 tsp Golden Mountain sauce
- 2 tsp brown sugar
- 1/4 tsp red chili flakes
- Lettuce

## Process

### Prep TVP (30 minutes before)

In a heatproof bowl, add just enough hot water to _saturate_ (**not cover**) the TVP, bouillon, and mushroom broth powder. Let soak for at least 30 minutes to allow the TVP to rehydrate.

### Make the sauce

In another bowl, mix together sesame oil, Chinese black vinegar, dark soy sauce, golden mountain sauce, brown sugar, and red chili flakes.

### Cook

Heat a wok or other heavy-bottomed skillet over high heat. Turn off the flame, add enough oil to coat the bottom of the pan, and bring the flame back up to medium-high heat. Add the TVP and cook, stirring to make sure it browns evenly, for 5 - 7 minutes or until well-browned.

Season generously with black pepper and add in minced garlic, cooking for another 30 seconds. Add sauce to taste and adjust seasoning as needed.

Serve in a large bowl with a hearty helping of whole leaf lettuce on the side.
