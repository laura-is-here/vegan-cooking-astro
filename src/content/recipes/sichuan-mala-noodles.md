## Ingredients

- 200g fresh alkaline noodles
- 20g light soy sauce
- 100g stock
- 60g oil
- 2 two inch sections of leek
- 1 inch ginger, smashed
- 30g chili flakes
- 1/2 Tbsp sesame seeds
- 10g sesame paste or tahini
- 10g sesame oil
- 1 tsp sugar
- 1/4 tsp salt
- 1/4 tsp MSG
- 1/2 tsp Chinese black vinegar
- 4g sichuan peppercorns, toasted and ground
- 10g peanuts, toasted and crushed
- 10g scallion, sliced
- 2 cloves garlic, smashed

## Directions

1.  _Toast the peanuts (\~3 min, med heat), the Sichuan peppercorns (\~90 seconds, med-low to low heat), and the yacai (\~1 min, residual heat)._ Toast the peanuts for about three minutes over medium heat until they’re just beginning to blacken and set them aside. Then toast the Sichuan peppercorns over medium low heat until they begin to blister and leave tiny little oil specks on your pan, and set them aside. With the residual heat, toast the yacai for about a minute until fragrant – a little’ll stick to the pan, that’s normal.
2.  _Slice the scallions, smash the garlic._ Random aside – the other day I saw a thread here extolling the benefits of pre-minced garlic because people don’t want the hassle of peeling the garlic. I certainly don’t look down on laziness, but if you’re looking to be lazy just smash your garlic. _Whack!_ Job’s done.
3.  _In a mortar: grind the Sichuan peppercorns to a powder, pound the garlic to a paste, smash the peanuts then peel._ All separate, of course. After smashing the peanuts, you can toss them in a little bowl and slightly blow on it to remove the peels.
4.  _To make the youlazi chili oil: fry the leek and the ginger for \~5 minutes, then remove._ These next two steps will be continuing the chili oil process. Fry the leek and ginger until the leek gets lightly golden brown.
5.  _Heat the oil up to \~220C, then shut off the heat and let it get back down to \~170C._ We’re heating the oil up to about smoke point in order to improve the taste. 150-170C is a good temperature to toss your chilis in, gets a good color and fragrance at that point.
6.  _Toss in the chilis and the sesame seeds. Fry for \~1 minute with the heat still off, then transfer to a bowl._ The chilis are going to bubble in a super satisfying kind of way.
7.  _Assemble the base of your noodle bowl._ I’ll list the amounts here, but yeah… it’s basically just half of each ingredient above. In a bowl toss in 50 grams of stock, 10 grams light soy sauce, 20 grams of the youlazi chili oil, 5 grams sesame paste, 5 grams sesame oil, ½ tsp sugar, 1/8 tsp salt, 1/8 tsp MSG, ¼ tsp dark Chinese vinegar.
8.  _Blanch your vegetable, if using._ For us, we blanched the spinach for \~20 seconds, then nestled it the bowl with the sauce.
9.  _Boil the noodles until just past al dente._ If you’re using different noodles than us, just follow the instructions. If you’re using fresh alkaline noodles, toss them in simmering water and cook until the desired consistency – for us, this was roughly four and a half minutes.
10. _Remove the noodles, fold them into the bowl, and top with the remaining ingredients._ This was half the peanuts (5g), half the scallions (5g), half the yacai, half the garlic, and \~1/2 tbsp of Sichuan peppercorn. Save any excess Sichuan peppercorn or, you know, just make it extra numbing.
